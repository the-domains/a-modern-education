# Frozen Learning

**Let me propose a thought experiment: You were cryogenically frozen in 1995\. When you wake up after 20 years, in 2015, the world is very different. You are amazed by the advances - the Internet and the World Wide Web, instantaneous telecommunications, massive medical and technological advances, huge social, political and economic changes and, thankfully, millions living with a much greater quality-of-life. The way we educate, however, has remained almost static. For well over 100 years, one teacher "with the knowledge" passes it on to 20 or more students sitting in rows who are "without knowledge". The crucial question is this: Is there a better way? A better way for students? For parents? For teachers? For schools? And, crucially, for society?**

**Teachers contribute tremendous value; much more than most people realise. The most successful and productive countries on the planet are united by the fact that they respect and prize the skills of teachers especially highly. In Finland for example, entry to teacher training courses is very competitive and statistically as difficult as getting into Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA. However, what makes the Finnish education system superior is that within the Finnish culture, training to be a teacher is so prestigious that the best and brightest students are drawn into the teaching profession. Outstanding teachers are definitely worth having. One study suggests that switching an average performing teacher to one performing in the top 5%, will increase each student's earning potential an average of $230,000 USD over the course of their career.**

**Inequality is magnified through education. Parents who can pay more are able to secure the top teachers to educate their children and, as a result, can increase their children's earnings over their lifetime. The most dedicated and wealthy parents have the choice of sending their children to fee-paying private schools. They may choose to employ personal tutors to get their children into academically selective schools and have the means to move into catchment areas for the best performing state schools. Less economically advantaged parents are mostly unable to make these decisions, and, as a result, their children receive an inferior education. In Australia, the Gonski Report suggested that there is as much as a three-year difference in performance for a child of the same age attending a state school compared to a private school.**
