# Batch Processing

**The modern form of education emerged at the dawn of the industrial age. The desire for individuals with exactly the same skills grew, and as a result education became much like fast food, a batch process where each student is taught, trained and tested in the same way. Students are grouped together in years, regardless of their talents. Much like Jamie Oliver's campaign for limiting fast food in schools, education around the world doesn't need a reform, but instead a revolution. Truly great education appears to be like the Michelin Star, taking the best out of every ingredient and treating it uniquely in order to produce the best outcome. Students who do not fit into the current traditional education paradigm, find themselves uncatered for by a system that insists they are "failing".**

**Many innovative and alternative forms of schooling are in practice today. The concept of "unschooling", for instance, often practised by homeschoolers, considers the very act of living as a great source of knowledge that naturally occurs, and that the educator's job is merely to enable students to experience life. Summerhill School in Suffolk, in the east of England, offers a democratic approach to schooling, with all management decisions, including punishment, being decided by a democratic process whereby both teachers and students hold equal power. Furthermore, students can choose whether to attend lessons and, critically, how they choose to learn. This may sound dangerous, I know, but it is surprising how mature and capable these young adults can be when they are offered responsibility. Since being opened in 1921, the school has produced many outstanding alumnae, from authors and academics, to architects and actors, despite accepting some of the most troubled students in the country.**

**The mainstream system often fails to care if students are not learning or experiencing the happiness and freedom of childhood. The underlying tacit belief is if students are not doing well at achieving the prescribed set of goals then they are lazy, not working hard enough, insolent or stupid. At a bare minimum, we are told that the children who do not perform well in exams are simply not as deserving of a place in one of the top universities, which, curiously, seem so very like the schools from which their students come. What is so amazing about these "industrial" schools is that they manage to take something as inherently profound as learning, and render it trivial.**
